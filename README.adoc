== 3D Occupancy Grid Mapping

=== Setup

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
git clone https://github.com/hankotanks/Occ3D.git
cd ./Occ3D

# build project and internal dependencies
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
----

=== Possible Issues

All dependencies should be bundled with the project.
However, Open3D sometimes fails to build if the system is missing an LLVM dependency.
This problem can occur in both the configuration and build stages.

.Configuration
[source,sh]
----
CMake Error at 3rdparty/find_dependencies.cmake:971 (find_library):
  Could not find CPP_LIBRARY using the following names: c++
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:613 (include)
----

The solution is to install the LLVM C++ standard library: 
[literal]
sudo apt-get install libc++-dev libc++abi-dev

.Building
[source,sh]
----
make[2]: *** No rule to make target '/usr/lib/llvm-16/lib/libc++.so.1', needed by 'voxelizer'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1177: CMakeFiles/voxelizer.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [Makefile:156: all] Error 2
----

Install the requested version off the LLVM standard library if the above error occurs during the build process (replace `16` with the version specified in the error message):
[literal]
sudo apt-get install libc++-16-dev libc++abi-16-dev
